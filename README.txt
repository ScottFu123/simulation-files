#This code should run in OpenFOAM-6 in CentOS or Ubuntu system.

#In pre processing, the generation of mesh can be realized by SnappyHexMesh module in OpenFOAM-6.
#The determination of boundaries are realized by topoSet and createPatch command.

#In runing process, the cases for nasal simulation should be run by DpmpimpleFoam, which is a redeveloped solver and needs to be recompiled by "wmake" command.

#The extra force generated by MV@GEL are embedded in \intermediate\submodels\Kinematic\ParticleForces. The original intermediate folder in $/src/lagrangian could be replaced by provided folder and should be recompiled by "wmake" command.
